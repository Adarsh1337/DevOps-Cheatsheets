## 1. Core Concepts

### What is DevOps?

* **DevOps** is a cultural philosophy and set of practices that
  combines software **Dev**elopment and IT **Op**erations
* It emphasizes collaboration, automation, continuous improvement,
  and rapid delivery
* DevOps breaks down silos between development, operations, and
  other stakeholders

### The Three Ways

The Three Ways form the philosophical foundation of DevOps:

1. **Flow** (Systems Thinking)
   * Optimize the entire value stream from development to production
   * Make work visible and reduce batch sizes
   * Eliminate waste and bottlenecks

2. **Feedback** (Amplify Feedback Loops)
   * Create short, fast feedback loops at all stages
   * Learn from failures quickly and implement corrections
   * Embed quality and security at every step

3. **Continual Learning and Experimentation**
   * Foster a culture of continuous learning
   * Encourage risk-taking and experimentation
   * Turn local discoveries into global improvements

## 2. CALMS Framework

CALMS is an acronym representing the key cultural and technical
pillars of DevOps:

| Pillar | Description | Key Practices |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **C**ulture | Shared responsibility | Blameless postmortems |
| **A**utomation | Eliminate manual toil | CI/CD, IaC |
| **L**ean | Optimize flow | Kanban, value streams |
| **M**easurement | Data-driven decisions | DORA metrics, logging |
| **S**haring | Knowledge transfer | Docs, open communication |

## 3. DORA Metrics (Measuring DevOps Performance)

The DORA team identified four key metrics that measure
software delivery performance:

### Deployment Frequency

How often code is deployed to production

* **Elite**: On-demand (multiple per day)
* **Low**: Between once per week and once per month

### Lead Time for Changes

Time from code commit to production

* **Elite**: Less than one hour
* **Low**: Between one week and one month

### Time to Restore Service

How quickly service is restored after incident

* **Elite**: Less than one hour
* **Low**: Between one week and one month

### Change Failure Rate

Percentage of changes that result in degraded service

* **Elite**: 0-15%
* **Low**: 46-60%

## 4. Key Cultural Values

### Shared Responsibility

* "You build it, you run it" - Teams own services end-to-end
* Break down silos between dev, ops, security, and QA
* Collective ownership of outcomes, not individual blame

### Blameless Postmortems

* Focus on systemic issues, not individual mistakes
* Psychological safety encourages honest discussion
* Turn incidents into learning opportunities

### Continuous Learning

* Allocate time for experimentation and learning
* Share knowledge through documentation, demos, and guilds
* Embrace failure as part of the learning process

### Transparency

* Make work visible (Kanban boards, dashboards)
* Share metrics and results openly
* Communicate early and often

## 5. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Consequence | Better Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Siloed teams | Delays, finger-pointing | Cross-functional collab |
| Hero culture | Burnout, SPOFs | Sustainable pace |
| "Not my problem" | Poor CX | Shared ownership |
| Blame culture | Fear, hiding mistakes | Psychological safety |
| Manual processes | Error-prone, slow | Automation |

## 6. Getting Started with DevOps

### For Individuals

1. Learn one scripting language (Bash, Python, PowerShell)
2. Master Git and version control workflows
3. Understand Linux fundamentals and command line
4. Explore one cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP)
5. Practice with containerization (Docker) and orchestration
   (Kubernetes)

### For Teams

1. Start small: Pick one process to automate
2. Measure your current baseline (DORA metrics)
3. Break down silos: Create cross-functional teams
4. Implement version control for everything
5. Establish a CI/CD pipeline for at least one application
6. Foster a culture of experimentation and learning

## 8. Gotchas & Best Practices

* **Don't treat DevOps as just tooling**: Culture and
  collaboration are more important than any tool
* **Avoid "DevOps team" silos**: DevOps is a culture for the
  entire organization, not a separate team
* **Start with quick wins**: Build momentum with small,
  visible improvements
* **Measure everything**: You can't improve what you don't
  measure
* **Embrace failure as learning**: Psychological safety
  enables innovation
